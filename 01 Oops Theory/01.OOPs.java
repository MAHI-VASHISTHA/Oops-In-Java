 * OOPs-> object oriented programming system.
 * software development methodology which relates to real world.
 * maintability
 * flexibily
 * extensible
 * reusible code/software
 * Modularity
 * data hiding
 * OOPs concepts:
 * 1.class
 * 2.objects
 * -----main 4 pilars-----
 * 1.inheritance
 * 2.encapsulation
 * 3.polymorphism
 * 4.abstraction
 * #Building
 * blueprint->class->(attribute and behavior)
 * 1. attributes = states = fields = data = variables
 * 2. behaviour = methods = functions
 * material(objects)
 * space
 * constructor-->initialize the things.
 * 
 * Ques-how many building can build using same blueprint?
 * Ans-many
 
 * Ques-is all objects attributes and behaviour will same?
 * Ans-yes
 
 * Ques-how to differentiate two objects?
 * Ans-every object has it's own unique identity.
 * 
 * changing one object attribute and behaviour can't effect other object.
 
 ************CONSTRUCTOR***********
 * construtor is a specific type of method which is used to initilize the data.
 * constructor does't have any return type.
 * constructor is called during the creting the object.
 * constructor name is same as class name. 
 * default constructor make by JVM implicity.
 * 
 * 
 * *********KEYWORDS*************
 * parent class = base class = super class
 * child class = derived class = sub class
 * 
 * *******************************
 * Inheritance:
 * 
 * Inheritance ->inheritance is a phenpmenon in which child inherits(gets)property from our ancestors(parents).
 * 
* types of inheritance:
1. single inheritance
2. multi-level inheritance
3. heirarchical inheritance
(belownot supported by java directly)
4.multiple inheritance
5. hybrid inheritance

* Polymorphism:
Poly-->many    morphs-->forms
1.static Polymorphism = static binding = early binding = compile time Polymorphs
2.Dynamic Polymorphism = Dynamic binding = late binding = run time Polymorphs

1.Static Polymorphism is acheives by Method Overloading
2.Dynamic Polymorphism is acheives by Method Overriding
